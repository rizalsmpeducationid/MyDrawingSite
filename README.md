# MyDrawingSite

A simple static website for drawing/sketching — built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎯 What is this

MyDrawingSite is a lightweight web-based drawing/sketch tool (or drawing-themed website) that runs purely in the browser — no backend needed. This means users can draw (or view drawings) locally just by opening the site, making it easy to deploy on any static hosting service (e.g. GitHub Pages).

## ✅ Features

- Pure static site: uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no server, no database.  
- Runs entirely in-browser: works offline once loaded.  
- Easy to set up: just open `index.html` in your browser (or host via static hosting).  
- Cross-platform: works on desktop and mobile browsers.  

*(Add more features here if you have — e.g. “save to image”, “undo/redo”, “color picker”, etc.)*

### 📝 Explanation & Why This Structure

- A README should start with a **clear title** and **short description** so that visitors immediately understand what the project does. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Including a **features list** and **project structure** helps others quickly see what the project contains and what it can do. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Providing **instructions to run/use the project** (how to clone, open, or host) lowers the barrier for others to test or contribute. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Listing the **tech stack** gives quick insight into what technologies are used — useful for collaborators or users.  
- A **contributing section** encourages others to help and keeps contributions organized. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Including **license info** (or at least placeholder) is important if you intend the project to be open-source or reusable. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
